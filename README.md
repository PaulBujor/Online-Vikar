The goal of the project was to create a system that will solve the longstanding problems
of the Vikar Companies and will serve as an improvement for their obsolete approach
of hiring people.

13 functional and 3 non-functional requirements were set. 

The system implements a server, database, and can have multiple users. Several GoF patterns were
implemented in order to build a firm architecture. The design for the client-side is based
on MVVM, whereas on the server-side Singleton, Remote Proxy, and Mediator patterns
were used. In the end, the system passed the testing successfully and all the
requirements were met.
